**Datastream in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is a **serverless change data capture (CDC) and replication service**. It allows you to **replicate data in real time** from source databases like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle** into **Google Cloud services** such as:

* **BigQuery** (for analytics)
* **Cloud Storage** (for batch processing or archival)
* **Cloud Spanner** or other services (via Dataflow)

---

### üîß **Key Features**

* **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Streams only changes instead of entire datasets.
* **Serverless & Scalable:** Google handles provisioning and scaling.
* **Near Real-Time Replication:** Ensures timely data availability for downstream processing.
* **Schema Conversion:** Converts schema from source databases to target formats.
* **Data Transformation:** Integrates well with Dataflow for in-stream transformations.

---

### üîÑ **Typical Use Case Flow**

1. **Source:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle (self-managed or Cloud SQL).
2. **Datastream:** Captures data changes using CDC.
3. **Destination:**

   * **Cloud Storage** (e.g., Avro files)
   * **BigQuery** (real-time analytics)
   * **Pub/Sub or Dataflow** for further processing

### üîê **Security & Management**

* IAM integration for access control.
* VPC peering to connect to private networks.
* Built-in monitoring via Cloud Monitoring and Logging.

---

### üìå Example Scenario:

You want to replicate transactional data from a MySQL database into BigQuery for analytics. Datastream captures the row-level changes, writes them to Cloud Storage in real time, and a Dataflow job continuously loads them into BigQuery.
